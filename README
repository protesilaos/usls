usls.el -- Unassuming Sidenotes of Little Significance
======================================================

WARNING: This software is pre-alpha quality.  There will be bugs,

improved or otherwise made different.


USLS, which may be pronounced as a series of letters or just "useless",
is a set of utilities for fleshing out a note-taking workflow that
revolves around a strict file naming convention and relies exclusively
on core Emacs tools.

usls.el is meant to be a simple tool for streamlining the process of
creating notes.  It does not provide utilities that already exist in the
Emacs milieu or standard Unix tools, such as dired or grep respectively.
As such, the focus is on the main points of interaction: (i) creating
notes, (ii) adding forward/backward references to other notes, (iii)
quickly browsing such references for the current file, (iv) visiting the
'usls-directory', (v) visiting a file that belongs to said directory.

Please refer to the 'defcustom' declarations in the source code.  Also
review the available commands by searching for the 'interactive' spec.


The file name convention
------------------------

All files created with usls have a file name that follows this pattern:

    DATE--CATEGORY--TITLE.EXTENSION

All fields are separated by two hyphens.

The DATE field represents the date in year-month-day followed by an
underscore and the current time in hour-minute-second notation.  The
presentation is compact, with only the underscore separating the two
components.  Like this: 20201108_091625.  The DATE serves as the unique
identifier of each note.

CATEGORY is one or more entries separated by a hyphen.  Items that need
to be more than one word long must be written with an underscore.  So
"emacs_library" is one category, while "emacs-library" are two.

The TITLE is the title of the note that gets extracted and hyphenated.
An entry about "This is a test" produces a "this-is-a-test" TITLE.

Some complete examples:

20201007_124941--economics--plentiful-and-predictable-liquidity.txt
20201007_104945--emacs-git--git-patch-formatting.txt
20201105_113805--monetary_policy--asset-bubbles-macroprudential-policy.txt


Main points of entry
--------------------

The aforementioned are handled automatically by the 'usls-new-note'
command.  Invoking it brings up a minibuffer prompt for entering the
note's title.  Once that is done, it opens a second prompt, with
completion, for inputting the category.  To enter multiple categories,
separate them with a comma or a space.  The date is always derived
automatically, while the EXTENSION is subject to a user-facing
customisation option.

Completion for categories presents a list that combines two sources: (1)
a customisable list of "known categories", (2) a dynamic list of
inferred categories from existing file names.  The latter is possible
due to the assumption that the file name convention is fully respected.

To create a new category, just enter text that does not match any of the
existing items.  To input multiple categories, separate them with a
comma or a space.  If your completion framework does not support such
actions, then it should be considered undesirable behaviour and reported
upstream.

A key feature of 'usls-new-note' is the ability to extract the current
region and place it below the area where the point will be in.  This is
useful for quickly capturing some text you wish to comment on and keep
it in context.

This blog post from 2020-10-08 describes the core ideas of usls:

Some references are out-of-date, since the library is expanded to
support Org and Markdown file types, while it can be configured to
access subdirectories inside the 'usls-directory'.
